# Tag or Branch Git Source on Release

I find tagging or branching sources on every build is too much noise. There are so many builds that are just thrown away and never make it out of CI. I prefer to tag\branch when I get to a specific environment with the artificats. Usually UAT or production. This is a vsts plugin that will git tag or branch artifact source code with the release name. This makes it very easy to patch in the future if needed. When the task runs it finds all linked artifacts that originated from a TfsGit source repo and tags or branches them with the release name. This is meant to be super simple. Just drop in your release pipeline and go. If you wish to configure a regular expression and pattern for the replacement that is also possible using the advanced settings.

Note: Currently this take does not support directly linked TfsGit artifacts. They must currently go though a build. Once [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent/issues/976) is fixed, those can be supported as well. I have no plans to support external git repos.
